Pyhon - Test-driven development. never forget to Test.
In this project i'l be tackling how to write test for python programs.besically  , writing test is a strong foundation for flexible and scallabe aplications.
 ive learnt that test are written to prove if the program responds as expected.

the procedure
-> write a proram that will fail.
-> then write the program code.
-> then test your program with the failing test to see if it will actually fail.
-> then write the correct tests
-> then test your code .
-> thrn write more codes.
-> then write more tests

main aim is to test driven development and eradicate fear of making a mistakes while coding, #Run the test as you continue to write your application.
